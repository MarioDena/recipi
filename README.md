The webapp should have at least 2 types of pages:

- one page with a list of items that could be filtered by some parameters; in the example project, it's a list of recipes that can be filtered by ingredients (shrimp, broccoli, etc.)
- one page for the item details; in this example, the product detail page (Preview Recipe)
